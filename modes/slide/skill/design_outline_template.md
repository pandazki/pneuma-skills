# Design Outline: {Deck Title}

## Tips for Writing Good Outlines

1. **Be specific about content**: Don't just write "data slide" — specify which data points, what chart type, what conclusion to draw
2. **Think about flow**: Each slide should logically lead to the next. The narrative should work without a presenter
3. **Plan density carefully**: One key idea per slide for presentations; more density OK for read-along decks
4. **Include layout hints**: Mentioning "two-column with chart on left" helps generate better slides
5. **Specify language explicitly**: If the user writes in Chinese but wants English slides (or vice versa), note this clearly
